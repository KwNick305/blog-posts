	The Courrières mining disaster is known to history as Europe’s worst mining disaster in which over 1,000 people died and many more were injured on the morning of Saturday, March 10, 1906. Due to the rapid advancement of communication technology, news of this incident spread across Europe in a short period of time. This news reached the English-speaking population of Alexandria through the _Daily Egyptian Gazette_. The first mention of the devastating loss of life was seen in the _Daily Egyptian Gazette_ on [March 12th, 1916] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dig-eg-gaz/page-images/master/1906-page-images-1/1906-03-12-p4.jpg) . Telegrams regarding this disaster took the top spot in the “To-Days Telegrams” section with 4 different wire reports detailing the incident. This can be contrasted with the articles in _The Times_ newspaper in London which dedicated multiple columns of page space to print detailed information about the disaster which took place in France. The explanation for the differences in this type of reporting has to do with how information was received be each of the two newspapers. Due to the close distance between England and France, _The Times_ had a correspondent on site who was able to spend large amounts of time writing his own articles for the exclusive use of that newspaper, and so was able to dedicate a large portion of his time and effort into composing a detailed article for the newspaper. On the other hand, the _Daily Egyptian Gazette_ received news from faraway places with [wire report services] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0305748881901195). Because these were sent through telegram, longer messages were more expensive and took longer to send and receive, so messages were often shortened to save time and money. Regardless of the differences in reporting, due to the advent of this new technology, news of such incidents was able to be spread around the world in a matter of hours, instead of days and weeks. This accident received media attention worldwide and many individuals and organizations around the world, including some Egyptians, were able to raise [charity donations to help the victims and their families] (https://scholarworks.wm.edu/honorstheses/153/). One can see the global interconnectedness which we take for granted today in its humble origins of the telegraph and the advent of fast and reliable global news.
