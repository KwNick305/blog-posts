This article from the September 17, 1907 issue of the Egyptian Gazette features an interaction betweem two quail hunters that I found to be quite comical. Quail hunting was a popular past time for the wealthy members of society such as Mr. Pergetti, the Italian school director who ends up with a bullet in his eye. It seems like those who were not wealthy enough to participate were less fond of the sport. For example, in [this article](https://go.gale.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Newspapers&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=4&docId=GALE%7CCS102586966&docType=Article&sort=Relevance&contentSegment=ZTMA-MOD1&prodId=TTDA&contentSet=GALE%7CCS102586966&searchId=R1&userGroupName=tall85761&inPS=true), President Einsenhower is being scorned for going on yet another quail hunt. While I'd like to think that this article was also published to poke fun at the aristocracy, it is more likely that the paper was simply reporting due to the injury. This is because the audience of this article was restriced to those who spoke English.

This accident occured because Mr. Poggetti rose out of his cover, an essential part of [quial hunting](http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=b927d6f7-f3e2-433d-bcb7-0d229bf6f9ef%40sessionmgr4007&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=20189595&db=a9h), to shoot his feathered target right as his unnamed friend fired his gun. The gun fired must've been a shotgun because only part of the charge hit Mr. Poggetti in the face. 

Rather than going to a hostipal like anyone would nowadays after taking a bullet to the eye, Mr. Poggetti recieved his medical assitance at home. In another case of [accidental shooting](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/post/18-blog-beasley/), a bridge foreman somehow managed to pull the trigger of a gun pointed into his own mouth while picking it up. This unfortionate foreman spent numerous days in the hospital. It seems that Mr. Perreti's ability to avoid going to the hospital likely correlates with his choice of sport.
