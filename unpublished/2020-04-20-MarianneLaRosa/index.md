## Egyptian Goddess
The Egyptian deities are a significant staple in Egyptian culture. Associated with numerous components of life, each god or goddess was celebrated and praised. While its religious following ended with the spread of Christianity, it remained ingrained in Egyptian history. One major goddess with a cult following is Hathor. Often portrayed as a woman with features resembling that of a cow, she was titled goddess of numerous things such as dancing, fertility, love, pleasure, beauty, and music. She was also known as the protector of women and was often shown praise by wearing cosmetics and offered up mirrors or cosmetic palettes. She was the goddess with the most the most temples built for her. Both men and women alike danced for Hathor in praise.

## A Beautiful Discovery
In an article published in the _The Egyptian Gazette_ , titled “Discovery at Thebes”, a shrine dedicated to the goddess Hathor was accidentally found. The shrine was described in detail in which it was depicted as “exquisite” with this being the first time a shrine was found of the goddess intact and life-sized. The shrine was found during an excavation at Thebes when a worker caused a large amount of debris to tumble down, exposing this statue of Hathor. The description of their find presented a beautiful image as it described the goddess to appear as in motion, stepping across water with lotus flowers on her. It is culturally significant to understand the ways in which people throughout time involved themselves with religion as it may be an indicator in which they lived their daily lives.
