On October 20th, 1906, Saturday's issue of the Egyptian Gazette was released. In this issue of the newspaper, on the third page, there was an article referring to “La Dame De Chez Maxim” a play being performed in the Esbekieh Gardens Theatre. The play was described as well known and a well constructed comedy. The author of the article also described the play as risque saying it might not appeal to everybody making this feel like a real review. The author also critiqued the actors performing the play identifying a few key actors that were very good such as Mme.Bellanger, M.Smith, and M. Lacroix who he identifies as having contributed to the success of the piece but also saying that the rest of the cast were only moderately good and did not really make the play better. Overall this piece is interesting because it provides a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and what they did for entertainment. For us in the modern age it is kind of hard to imagine life without all the luxuries most people have nowadays and things like this shows that the people back then were not any different than us they still craved entertainment and still found enjoyment in watching interesting performances and learning about interesting stories which are both things that many people today can relate to which means that people at their core are not that different from each other even if they are separated by many years.
