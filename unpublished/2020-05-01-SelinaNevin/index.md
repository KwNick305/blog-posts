In this article of the Egyptian Gazette from August 16, 1907, the author is raising his concerns with the building bye laws concerning fireplaces. The Municipality of Alexandria is set to approve new building regulations in the next week and will require a submission of the location of a chimney prior to the start of construction when previously it could be >“merely a hole cut through the wall at some suitable spot to be chosen after the building is finished.” The new code demands many different drawings and documents to be submitted before construction may begin and the author seems to be frustrated with these new impositions and their costs. However, his true qualm is not with the new regulations on chimneys, but with the inaction of the Municipality to increase street safety and function. His mention of a walk down the street, >“or rather, a series of darts and dodges along the narrow footway” showcase where frustrations of Alexandrians really lay.  If this author is to represent popular opinion at the time, Alexandrians seem to be less concerned with visual aesthetics of chimneys on new houses and more concerned with getting to work safely as they walk down the street. However, since the Municipality chose the requirements of the new building code and had not yet taken action on the widening of certain streets, this shows that perhaps those with influence in Alexandria care less about pedestrian safety and more about creating an elite, residential area suitable to their high standards.    This introduction of standards for new homes is comparable to the limitations set by Homeowners’ Associations today. Like HOAs, the Municipality of Alexandria, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would be excluding those who could not afford the costs of their new requirements. This gentrification is a harbinger for the expulsion of the underprivileged in order to create exclusively wealthy spaces. If property taxes were to function in 20th century Alexandria the same as they do today, then it will be these neighborhoods, ones where the residents can afford to abide by new regulations, that will have the most to spend on improving public spaces like streets and sidewalks. A question may be raised concerning the layout of the city and whether wealthier neighborhoods correlate to safer, widened streets.
