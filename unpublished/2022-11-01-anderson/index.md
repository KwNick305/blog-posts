In the mid-19th century, Russia was looking to expand their empire into the Crimean Peninsula, which was held by the Ottoman Empire. Britain and France aided the Turks in stopping Russia. Since then, Russia was not too fond of England, that was until 1907. While transcribing the September 7th, 1907 edition of the _Egyptian Gazette_, I came across quite an interesting story. The editor, Reuter, wrote about an "Anglo-Russian Agreement," as in a treaty between England and Russia.

Seeing as how the British policed Russia half a century prior, I was a bit puzzled as to why they would make an agreement. Digging a bit below the surface gave me that result. Britain and Russia settled some arguments they had over land in Central Asia, Persia, Tibet, and Afghanistan. Persia was primarily taken by Russia, while Britain's power in Afghanistan was respected. Tibet was left largely alone by both states. So that is it, right? Just land disputes? Well perhaps not, as World War I was just around the corner. It was common knowledge that war was inevitable in Europe, so alliances were everything in this period. Russia was already allied with France, so having Britain by their side would make winning a potential war signficantly easier. Thus, the Triple Entente was born.
